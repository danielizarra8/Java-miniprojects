# Zombie dice- 
A very basic Zombie dice game using Java. 
I wrote this code as part of an assignment for my first year.
I know the code it is a bit messy and difficult to read. I have tryed to leave comments as much as I could to let other knows what i was doing. 
If you have any suggestions, please let me know, I am always happy to learn from others.
